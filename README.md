# Image_to_XLSX
Image to XLSX (100x100) script. Seriously useless and meaningless.
## Prerequisites
- PIL
- NumPy
- OpenXL
- format.xlsx
- ... and any image!  
Had to prepare format.xlsx because file size dramatically increased when format file was created by script
## Features
- Auto resizing and center aligning
- Transparency Issue solved (automatically set as white background)
## Future Plans
- Various sheet size & Optimizing
- Video & GIFs support
